								<p>Hello there, and thanks for taking the time to learn more about both my professional, and personal life. Professionally my career history includes experience in Information technology support and network administration and most recently, web development.
								</p>
								<p> Many people these days have a carefully crafted self-branded image they manage thru social media; like being a musician that also does magic tricks or a Samba Dancer who’s a part time truck driver.   My brand is just me, Jett Kendrick.   A this point in my young life I haven’t had that life altering experience that makes for a witty and cleverly thrilling story. I haven't climbed the Inca trail to see the ancient sites of Machu Picchu, I haven't traveled the world embarking on a journey of self-discovery.  I haven’t gone backpacking across Europe with no money with only my wit and charm to keep my stomach full and my head dry. I don’t know what the word sabbatical really is nor do I want to go on one.  I guess there was this one time I was sort of stranded in downtown Chicago without my wallet, with a dead cellphone, and needing a way to get home. Through a series of awkward interactions with kind strangers I was able to find my way back to my crib, (I might not be hip enough to use that word).  Some might argue the trip from Chicago’s downtown loop to Lakeview was a cool travel experience much like taking the train from Paris to Brussels. I am not sure who those people are, but they may be out there.  If I am stretching for my exciting story, I did play in a band for about a week in high school, and we played a sold out show for six people in some guys backyard.  It was a very small but packed SRM backyard.  If I had only done magic tricks at the same time, I was playing my horn I guess I could have had a brand.  I feel confident that my future holds many exciting stories and I look forward to the journey……even if it might only be to downtown and back. </p>

								<p> I'm lucky enough to have an amazing and beautiful twenty-month-old daughter.  I am a very doting father and let me tell you something; I'll dote on my daughter all day! No shame in my game. I am a single father, and I have been taking care of her on my own since she was born.  It can be a lot of responsibility sometimes, but I’ve come to love being a father. She's the best thing to happen to me as well as the most important person in my life. To be honest, she is the driving force behind me wanting to progress even further in my professional career and my main source of motivation. I want the means to support her as much as I possibly can and provide her the quality life she deserves. I have high expectations as a father for her upbringing. It is something that is very important to me. I've fought very hard to obtain the position I have in her life, and I don't intend to stop working hard anytime soon; whether that be at my job or personally just proving that fathers are completely capable of taking care of their children on their own.</p>

								<p> As far as what I spend my time doing personally, the majority of it is spent either working or doing dev stuff and hanging out with my little lady. That's not to say I don't occasionally have a little time to spare to do other things; as I do have some hobbies actually; besides working hard and being close to solving the problem of world peace I do enjoy playing video games. Ignoring the world peace thing for now to provide some more insight into my gaming.  I love any games that are developed by Nintendo, and I play a lot of JRPGs as I am kind of an Otaku weeb. I am also a big sports fan; I love the NBA. It's hard for me to say this to people these days without being called a "bandwagon fan", but as a Cali born Bay Area native.  I am a diehard Golden State Warriors fan.  I am a legitimate fan as my father had season tickets, and the first game I attended I was seven months old.  Born during the run TMC days and I was certainly a fan pre-their second championship in 2015.  In fact, I know more about the NBA then just about everyone I meet so my fandom is legit. Or as those of us from the bay Area will often quote one of our own MC Hammer and say, “too legit, too legit to quit”.  I prefer reddit to Instagram and I also hate avocados. I know it's a pretty hot take, but I think they're awful and are overrated. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Stelt</h2>
								<p> This is a web application I personally created. It's a style focused app centered around celebrities and their outfits. The main goal of the app is to allow users to emulate the styles of their favorite celebs at affordable prices.  The inspiration behind this idea came from seeing LeBron James pull up to last year’s NBA Finals clad in a $45,000 suit that replaced the more typical pair of slacks for a pair of uhm...suit shorts.  Anyways, I thought to myself there must be an affordable way for people to dress like the stars. On my app you'll find pictures of various famous people, and their outfits. When you select an outfit, you are brought to a page that displays pictures of products that look like each individual item the celebrity is wearing.  Clicking on that picture pulls up the site the item is hosted on, and the prices are affordable for us Normals.  That's the main feature of the application. Just because you don't possess the looks the bod or the hair doesn't mean you can't copy what they wear inexpensively.</p>

								<p> The backend for my app was built using Rails along with Postgresql database containing several models and joint tables, and the frontend for this project was Vue.JS based. It also includes the tumblr-Api which under my original intention was meant to be used in conjunction with another Api from Thread Genius. Which was a style focused image recognition Api with built in catalogues with thousands of products from places like Shopstyle etc., as well as fashion blogs, allowing you to take an image of an outfit and have it search for products that look similar. The Thread Genius Api would have been very cool but unfortunately, they were acquired by another company recently leaving their Api unusable. So now my plan B for my app is to add APIs from some fashion brands in order to pull up their catalog in the app to make outfit creation even easier.</p>

								<p> As far as other ongoing projects, I'm currently working with partners building a 2-D Platform game on Unity as an enjoyable side project.  It's been a lot of fun so far.  Specifically, I've been working on writing the C# scripts for the enemy AI, and also things like the game physics. Hopefully we will launch a playable version on here soon.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Lily</h3>
								<p> First off, we have my lovely daughter Liliana Kendrick aka Lily my Love. She is my pride and joy, my best bud, and is the shining light in my world. She is cute, sweet, and basically any other positive adjective you can think of.  She grows more and more every day; fast approaching the age of two and watching her grow these last 20 months has been a blessing.  She is a goofball who likes to have fun and laugh. Watching her do the things she does makes me laugh too. I've always thought of children as miniature comedians really in how they act and the kinds of things they say. She likes to dance and she's quite good at it too having inherited her father’s remarkable rhythm. There is not much else to say other then she is the best, and I look forward to watching her grow up even more. I plan to always be there for her and want her to have a great life.</p>
								<h3 class="major">grend</h3>
								<p> Next is my cat Grend and she is my friend. She’s more than that to me; this woman is my rock. She's a furry partner for me to lean on. Sometimes I come home from a tough day, take a seat on the couch, and immediately she is right there on my lap giving me the cuddles.  She is the one that pushed me towards a change in career when my desire to do so was teetering on the fence.  Seriously, she said to me "Hey honey. You gotta do this. You know it's what you want to do and you know what? I'll be there to support you every step of the way." She didn’t exactly speak English and it was actually a series of purrs and meows, but I am sure it can only be transcribed as the former.</p>
