								<p>Hello there, and thanks for taking the time to learn more about both my professional, and personal life. Professionally my career history includes experience in fields such as: working in the bar industry throughout school, an It support role that includes some network administartion related duties, and most recelently, web development.
								</p>
								<p> I Don't have anyway to brand myself like some may have; like being a musician, nor do I have any worldy life altering experiences that have helped shaped who I am. I haven't climnbed the inca trail to see the ancient sites of Machu Picchu, I Haven't taken a sabbatical to travel the world an embark on a journey of self discovery or gone backpacking across Europe with no money. I mean I guess there was this one time I was sort of stranded in downtown Chicago without my wallet, dead cellphone, and needing a way to get back home. Through a series of awkward interactions with kind strangers I was able to find my way back home. And some would even say a trip from the loop to lakeview is much like the traveling experience of going from Prague to Amsterdam so that cool. Now that I think about it I was in a band for about a week in high school, and we played a sold out show of like SIX people in some guys backyard.  what I saw in my head though as we were performing, it was like we were playing a sold out show at the Garden and we were the Beatles peak Beatlemania. That's the way I am going always remember it.  So yeah, maybe I am a musician then. There you go I've just found my brand. </p>

								<p> I'm lucky enough to have an amazing and beautiful 20 month old daughter.  I am a very doting father, and let me tell you something; I'll dote on my daughter all day! No shame in my game. I am a single father, and I have been taking care of her on my own since she was born.  It can be alot of responsibility sometimes, but Iv'e come to love being a dad. She's the best thing to happen to me as well as the most important person in my life. To be honeest, she is the driving force behind me wanting to progress even further in my professional career and my main source of motivation. I want the means to support her as much as I possibly can, and provide her with the kind of quality life that she deserves. I have high expectations for myself as a father as to what I want her upbringing to be like. It is something that  very important to me. I've fought very hard to obtain the postion I have in her life, and I don't intend to stop working hard anytime soon; whether that be at my job or just in proving that fathers are capable of taking care of children on there own too.</p>

								<p> As far as what I spend my time doing peronsally, the majority of it is spent either working or doing dev stuff, and hanging out with my little lady. That's not to say I don't occaisonally have a little time to spare to do other things; as I do have some hobbies actually; which mostly includes playing video games to be honest. To provide more speceficity as to what kinds of games I enjoy; I love any games that are developed by Nintendo, and I play alot of JRPGs as I am kind of an Otaku weeb. I am also a big sports fan; I love the NBA. It's hard for me to say this to people these days without being called a "bandwagon fan", but as a Bay area native who grew up there up out there through high school; I am a die hard Golden State Warriors fan.  I am actually a legitimate fan as my father had season tickets, I've gone to many games since I was a kid, and was a fan pre 2015.  In fact, I know more about the NBA then just about everyone I meet so my fandom is legit. Also, I go on reddit and not instagram. one last thing to note is that I don't like avacados. I know it's a pretty hot take but I think they suck and are overated. </p>

								<p> This is an web application I personally created. It's a style focused app centered around celebreties and their outfits. The main goal of the app is to allow users to emulate the styles of their favorite celebs at affordable prices.  The inspiratoin behind this idea came from seeing LeBron james pull up to last years NBA Finals clad in a $45,000 suit that replaced the more typical pair of slacks for a pair of uhh...suit shorts. anyways, I thought to myself there has to be a affordable way for people to dress like the stars. On my app you'll find pictures of various famous people, and there outfits. When you select an outfit you are brought to a page that displays pictures of products that look simular to each individual item the celebrity is wearing.  clicking on that picture pulls up the site the item is hosted on, and the prices are affordable for us normals. that's the main feature of the application. Just because you don't possess the looks the bod or the hair; it doesn't mean you can't copy what they wear.</p>

								<p> The backend for my app was built using Rails along with Postgresql database containing several models and joint tables, and the frontend for this project was Vue.JS based. It aslo includes the tumblr-Api which under my original intention was meant to be used in conjunction with another Api named Thread Genius. It was a style focused image recognition Api with built in catalogues with thousands of products from places like shopstyle etc. as well as fashion blogs, allowing you to take an image of an outfit and have it pull up products that look simular. it woild have been very cool but unfortunately they were acquired recently leaving their Api unusable. So now Plan B when I get the chance is to add Apis from some fashion brands in order to pull up their catalog in app to make outfit creation even easier</p>

								<p> As far as other ongoing projects, I'm currently working with some guys building a 2-D Platform game on Unity as a fun side project.  it's been alot of fun so far, and I've been working on writing the C# scripts for the enemy AI, and also things like the game physics. Hopefully we can get out a playable level out soon</p>

								<h3 class="major">Lily</h3>
								<p> First off we have my lovely daughter Liliana Kendrick aka Lily my Love. She is my pride and joy, my best bud, and is the shining light in my world. she is cute, sweet, and basically any othet positive adjective you can think of.  she grows more and more everyday; fast approaching the age of two and watching her grow these last 20 months has been a blessing.  she is a goofball who likes to have fun, and laugh. Watching her do the things she does makes me laugh too. I've always thought of children as like miniature comedians really in how they act and the kinds of things they say. She likes to dance and she's quite good at it too having inhereted her fathers remarkable rythm. There is really not much else to say other then she is the best, and I look foward to watching her grow up even more. I plan to always be there for her, and want her to have a great life.</p>
								<h3 class="major">grend</h3>
								<p> Next is my cat Grend and she is my friend. Actually, shes more then that to me; this woman is my rock. She's a furry partner for me to lean on. Sometimes I come home from a tough day, take a seat on the couch, and immediately she is right there on my lap giving me the cuddles.  She is the one that actually pushed me towards change in career when my desire to do so was teetering on the fence.  she said to me "Hey honey. you gotta do this. you know it's what you want to do. and you know what? I'll be there to support you every step of the way." It was actually just a series of purrs and meows, but I am sure it can onky be transcribed as the former.</p>
